The OMT-G data model
--------------------

The OMT-G model was first proposed by Borges (1997).

In 2000, Davis came up with suggestions to the OMT-G model with the inclusion of transformation and presentation class diagrams. In 2001, Borges, Davis and Laender published Borges et al. (2001) with the compilation of the works of Borges (1997) and Davis (2000), which included a comparison between the OMT-G model and other proposals for conceptual modeling in geographic database. Integrity constraints on OMT-G geospatial database is presented in Borges et al. (1999) and Davis et al. (2001). In 2005, Borges et al. addressed the class diagrams, transformation diagrams, presentation diagrams, integrity constraints on geospatial database and mapping of OMT-G conceptual models for implementation schemes.
