Creating a Spatial Database
===========================

PgAdmin
-------

PostgreSQL has a number of administrative front-ends.  The primary one is `psql <http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-psql.html>`_ a command-line tool for entering SQL queries.  Another popular PostgreSQL front-end is the free and open source graphical tool `pgAdmin <http://www.pgadmin.org/>`_. All queries done in pgAdmin can also be done on the command line with ``psql``. 

#. Find pgAdmin and start it up.

#. If this is the first time you have run pgAdmin, you should have a server entry for **PostGIS (localhost:5432)** already configured in pgAdmin. Double click the entry, and enter anything you like at the password prompt to connect to the database.

   The PostGIS database has been installed with unrestricted access for local users (users connecting from the same machine as the database is running). That means that it will accept *any* password you provide. If you need to connect from a remote computer, the password for the ``postgres`` user has been set to ``postgres``.


Creating a Database
-------------------

#. Open the Databases tree item and have a look at the available databases.  The ``postgres`` database is the user database for the default postgres user and is not too interesting to us.  

#. Right-click on the ``Databases`` item and select ``New Database``.

   .. image:: ./screenshots/pgadmin_03.png
     :class: inline

#. Fill in the ``New Database`` form as shown below and click **OK**.  

   .. list-table::

     * - **Name**
       - ``nyc``
     * - **Owner**
       - ``postgres``


   .. image:: ./screenshots/pgadmin_02.png
     :class: inline

#. Select the new ``nyc`` database and open it up to display the tree of objects. You'll see the ``public`` schema.

   .. image:: ./screenshots/pgadmin_04.png

#. Click on the SQL query button indicated below (or go to *Tools > Query Tool*).

   .. image:: ./screenshots/pgadmin_05.png

#. Enter the following query into the query text field to load the PostGIS spatial extension:

   .. code-block:: sql

     CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
           
#. Click the **Play** button in the toolbar (or press **F5**) to "Execute the query." 

#. Now confirm that PostGIS is installed by running a PostGIS function:

   .. code-block:: sql

     SELECT postgis_full_version();

You have successfully created a PostGIS spatial database!!


Function List
